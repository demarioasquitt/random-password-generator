# Random Password Generator
## With Python

For a personal project, I need to generate multiple random passwords. I got tired of doing the process manually and decided to write a Python script to do it for me. 

In the future, it might be interesting to generate a GUI. But for now, it serves its purpose: generating random passwords from the command line. 

By default, the password length is 20 characters, but you are able to change this. Each password is composed of a random mix of ascii letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and puntuaction signs.
